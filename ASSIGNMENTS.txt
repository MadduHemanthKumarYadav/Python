Assignment - 1
Create two sets and perform set operations on them.

#CODE
set1 = {1,2,3,4}
set2 = {3,4,5,6}
#adding elements to the set
set1.add(7)
set2.add(9)
print(set1)
print(set2)

#OUTPUT

{1, 2, 3, 4, 7}
{3, 4, 5, 6, 9}


#CODE
set1 = {1,2,3,4}
set2 = {3,4,5,6}
#Union Operation
set3 = set1.union(set2)
print(set3)

#OUTPUT

{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}


#CODE
set1 = {1,2,3,4}
set2 = {3,4,5,6}
#Intersection Operation
set4 = set1.intersection(set2)
print(set4)

#OUTPUT

{3, 4}


#CODE

set1 = {1,2,3,4}
set2 = {3,4,5,6}
#Difference Operation
set5 = set1.difference(set2)
print(set5)

#OUTPUT

{1, 2}


#CODE

set1 = {1,2,3,4}
set2 = {3,4,5,6}
#Checking whether set2 is subset of set1
set2.issubset(set1)

#OUTPUT

False


#CODE

set1 = {1,2,3,4}
set2 = {3,4,5,6}
#Checking whether set2 is superset of set1
set2.issuperset(set1)

#OUTPUT

False


#CODE
set1 = {1,2,3,4}
set2 = {3,4,5,6}
#Checking whether set1 and set2 are dijoint sets
set1.isdisjoint(set2)

#OUTPUT

False


Assignment - 2
Create a function which takes two user inputs as operands and the operation symbol to be performed on them as the user input as well and perform the calculation.

#CODE

def calc():
  n1 = int(input("Enter the first operand: "))
  n2 = int(input("Enter the second operand: "))
  o = input("Enter the operator: " )
  if(o == '+'):
         print("The sum is ",(n1+n2))
  elif(o == '-'):
         print("The difference is ",(n1-n2))
  elif(o == '*'):
         print("The product is ",(n1*n2))
  elif(o == '/'):
         print("The quotient is ",(n1/n2))
  elif(o == '%'):
         print("The remainder is ",(n1%n2))
  else:
         print("Invalid Operator")
calc()

#OUTPUT

Enter the first operand: 6
Enter the second operand: 7
Enter the operator: *
The product is  42



Assignment - 3
What are the modes r+, w+, a+ and give examples for each.

r+ mode:
In r+ mode, we can read and write the file, but the file pointer position is at the beginning of the file, if we write the file directly, it will overwrite the beginning content of the file.

#CODE

f = open("myfile.txt","r")
print(f.read())
f.close()

#OUTPUT

Hello all, 
This is my file. 

#CODE

f = open("myfile.txt","r+")
f.write("new line\n")
print(f.read())
f.close()

#OUTPUT

, 
This is my file.

w+ mode:
It Opens a file for both writing and reading. It Overwrites the existing file if the file exists. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for reading and writing.

#CODE

f = open("myfile.txt",'w')
f.write("Hi all \n This is a new file.")
f.close()
f = open("myfile.txt",'r')
print(f.read())
f.close()

#OUTPUT

Hi all 
 This is a new file.


#CODE

f = open("myfile1.txt",'w+')
f.write("Hi all \n This is a new file.")
f.close()
f = open("myfile1.txt","r")
print(f.read())
f.close()

#OUTPUT

Hi all 
 This is a new file.



a+ mode:
It Opens a file for both appending and reading. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file exists. The file opens in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for reading and writing.

#CODE

f = open("myfile.txt","a")
f.write("\nThis is a new line")
f.close()
f = open("myfile.txt",'r')
print(f.read())
f.close()

#OUTPUT

Hi all 
 This is a new file.
This is a new line


#CODE

f = open("myfile3.txt",'a+')
f.write("This is a new file")
f.close()
f = open("myfile3.txt",'r')
print(f.read())
f.close()

#OUTPUT

This is a new file
